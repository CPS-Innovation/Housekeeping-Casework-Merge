## Features

### Reclassify to Unused Functionality

The "Reclassify to Unused" action allows users to bulk reclassify materials and communications as "Unused" status.

#### How it works:

1. **Materials Tab**:

   - Select one or more materials using the checkboxes
   - Click the "Actions" dropdown menu
   - Click "Reclassify to Unused" button (now enabled when items are selected)
   - Selected materials will be marked as "Unused" with a red status tag
   - Items become visually dimmed to indicate their unused status
   - Success notification shows which items were reclassified

2. **Communications Tab**:
   - Select one or more communications using the checkboxes
   - Click the "Actions" dropdown menu
   - Click "Reclassify to Unused" button (now enabled when items are selected)
   - Selected communications will be marked as "Unused" with a red status tag
   - Items become visually dimmed to indicate their unused status

#### Technical Implementation:

- **JavaScript Functions**: `reclassifyMaterialsToUnused()` and `reclassifyCommsToUnused()`
- **CSS Classes**: Items get the `reclassified-unused` class for visual feedback and `material_Unused` class for filtering
- **Status Updates**: Status tags are updated to show "Unused" with red styling
- **Filtering**: Reclassified items work with the existing filter system
- **Notifications**: Success banners show confirmation of the action

#### What was fixed:

- ❌ **Before**: Buttons were disabled and called wrong functions (`pageActions()` for PDF editing)
- ✅ **After**: Buttons work correctly with proper click handlers and show visual feedback
- ❌ **Before**: No actual reclassification happened
- ✅ **After**: Items are properly reclassified with status updates and filtering support
